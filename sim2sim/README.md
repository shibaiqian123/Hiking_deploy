# sim2sim — validate the deployment stack in MuJoCo before the real robot

`g1_mujoco_bridge.py` is a **robot impersonator**: a MuJoCo simulation that
speaks the exact same interfaces as a real Unitree G1, so that
`scripts/g1_parkour_laptop.py` runs **completely unmodified** against it:

| Real robot | Bridge equivalent |
|---|---|
| `/lowstate` (motors + pelvis IMU, DDS) | published from MuJoCo state at ~500 Hz |
| `/secondary_imu` (torso IMU) | published from the torso body |
| `/wirelesscontroller` (joystick) | published from **keyboard** input |
| motor-level PD in the actuators | `tau = kp(q_des−q) + kd(dq_des−dq) + tau_ff` per step |
| Jetson ZMQ depth broadcast (:5555) | MuJoCo depth render from the `depth_camera` (D435 mount, fovy 58) → raw z16 on **:5556** |
| a person holding the robot | virtual gantry (toggle keys 9/8) |

The default scene is the gx_loco_deploy staircase (**0.30 m tread / 0.075 m
rise — the training stair dimensions**). Point `--scene` at any other MJCF
that includes the same `g1.xml`.

## Official training terrain (all 10 sub-terrain types)

`gen_training_terrain.py` loads the **exact training terrain config**
(`ROUGH_TERRAINS_CFG` from InstinctMJ's parkour task: perlin rough plane ×2,
square gaps, pyramid stairs up/down × normal/high, sparse/dense boxes,
inverted pyramid slope — a curriculum grid, one terrain type per column,
difficulty increasing per row) and bakes it into a bridge-ready `.mjb`
scene with proper heightfield collisions:

```bash
# one-time generation — needs the mjlab virtualenv (mjlab + torch):
/home/galbot/mjlab/my_mjlab_project/.venv/bin/python sim2sim/gen_training_terrain.py
# then run the bridge on it (spawn args are printed by the generator):
source sim2sim/env_sim.sh
python sim2sim/g1_mujoco_bridge.py \
    --scene sim2sim/assets/training_terrain_scene.mjb \
    --spawn_x -12.00 --spawn_y -36.00 --spawn_height 0.760
```

Notes: requires the `InstinctMJ` checkout next to this repo; the deploy venv
pins `mujoco==3.8.1` to match the mjlab venv (`.mjb` is version-locked);
`--rows/--cols/--seed` reroll the grid; **`--no-noise` disables the perlin
surface roughness** (official geometry kept, rough-plane columns become flat
ground — nicer for interactive driving). Generated assets live under
`sim2sim/assets/` (gitignored — regenerate after cloning).

## Watching the depth pipeline live

The bridge's ZMQ depth broadcast speaks the same protocol as the robot's, so
the standard viewer works — run it in a third terminal alongside the deploy
script (ZMQ PUB supports multiple subscribers):

```bash
source sim2sim/env_sim.sh
real_time_img --source zmq --zmq-addr tcp://127.0.0.1:5556 --stages
```

This opens a window showing the sim's RAW depth render next to every
processing stage down to the exact observation the policy receives.

## Safety model

`sim2sim/env_sim.sh` re-binds DDS to the **loopback interface only**, so
running the deploy script with `--nodryrun` can physically never reach a real
robot. Always source it (not `setup_env.sh`) in every sim2sim terminal.

## Run

```bash
# terminal 1 — the simulated robot (viewer window opens)
source sim2sim/env_sim.sh
python sim2sim/g1_mujoco_bridge.py

# terminal 2 — the UNMODIFIED deploy script
source sim2sim/env_sim.sh
python instinct_onboard/scripts/g1_parkour_laptop.py \
    --zmq_addr tcp://127.0.0.1:5556 --nodryrun
```

Then drive it from the **viewer window** keyboard exactly like the real
joystick flow:

Letter keys are mostly avoided — the MuJoCo viewer binds many of them to
visualization toggles (W = wireframe, R = reflection, S = shadow, ...).

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | "any button" pulse (wakes the deploy script's buffer wait) |
| `7` | R1 — cold_start → stand, or parkour → stand |
| `6` | L1 — stand → parkour |
| `↑` | forward ON (vx = +0.5 m/s in parkour) |
| `↓` | STOP — zero all velocity commands |
| `←` / `→` | turn left / right — **1 s pulse per press**, then auto-zero (like flicking a real stick) |
| `E` | L2 — emergency-stop test (deploy exits, robot goes limp) |
| `9` / `8` | virtual gantry on / off ("let go of the robot") |
| `+` / `-` | teleport one terrain **difficulty row** up / down (training-terrain scenes; same column, pose kept, gantry re-engaged — press `8` to release; the deploy script keeps running seamlessly) |
| `*` / `/` | switch **terrain type** — next / previous column at the current difficulty (wraps around; `*` needs the keypad) |
| `.` | toggle camera **follow ↔ free**: follow (default) keeps the robot centred, including across `+`/`-`/`*`//` teleports; free lets you drag the view with the mouse (it starts aimed at the robot) |

Suggested sequence: wait for cold start to settle → `7` (stand) → `8`
(release the gantry, see if the stand policy balances) → `6` (parkour) →
`↑` (walk forward towards the stairs).

## Notes / limitations

- The bridge holds all joints at the spawn pose with a weak damped PD until
  the first `/lowcmd` arrives — mimicking the real robot's damped "reset"
  state (`L2+A` / `L2+B`), and required so the limp model doesn't fold past
  the deploy stack's joint-protection limits.
- The gantry is a "safety net": vertically it only catches the robot below
  its normal standing height (so releasing it stores no force — no sudden
  load change), horizontally it anchors the pelvis with a gentle always-on
  spring (prevents the slow foot-drift that made cold start's "Reached"
  state flicker), plus a mild upright torque on pelvis (beyond 12° tilt)
  and torso. The torso assist exists because the waist kp (28.5) is
  marginally below the torso's gravity gradient — without a "steadying
  hand" the torso sags to a large-angle equilibrium during cold start,
  exactly as a real robot would.
- With no deploy script running, nothing balances the robot — it may lean
  over and hang on the gantry (the depth view then shows far-range only).
  This is expected; start the deploy script for a balanced robot.
- Depth is rendered noise-free at 848×480@30fps; the deploy-side pipeline
  (mm→m, resize, crop, blur, normalize) is identical to the real path.
- Scene assets live in the gx_loco_deploy checkout (see `DEFAULT_SCENE` in
  the bridge); pass `--scene` to use your own copy.
- Automated end-to-end check (headless): the full
  cold_start → stand → parkour chain has been verified with `--headless`
  plus `ros2 topic pub` button pulses; `/lowcmd` stays at 50 Hz throughout.
